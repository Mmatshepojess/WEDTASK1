First of all, I added CSS to my website to make it look more appealing. I created a Readme file to show my coding. I added comments to my HTML coding. I used CSS for my nagivationbar to make it look more goodlooking. I also defined the structure of my website using padding and margins with CSS. All my pictures are loading properly. I made sure that all my webpages are linked to one another.
