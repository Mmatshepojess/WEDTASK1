1.	The Organizaton Overview

Bubble tea was established in 1995, in the province of Cape town in V&A Waterfront-bay. Bubble tea is a tea-based drink most often containing chewy, sweet, tropical fruit blends and delicious flavoring. Bubble tea is also known as boba tea. Bubble tea is most commonly made with tapioca pearls (also known as “boba” or “balls”). Experience the discovery of the joy that comes from the chewy tapioca pearls (boba) in every sip. The tapioca pearls (boba) are the signature element of our bubble tea creations.  We have many varieties and different kinds of flavors, but our most popular varieties are pearls black milk tea and pearl green milk tea. We have the finest tea in the world, it’s inspiring and it nurtures the human spirit. One of the biggest draws of boba tea is the ability to customize it according to your own liking, from the type of favorite tea and sweetness levels to a variety of toppings to choose from. This customization makes every cup unique and enjoying every moment to the last sip. Bubble tea is perfect for a quick pick-me-up or delightful treat with friends and family. Due to popularity, bubble tea has inspired a variety of bubble tea flavourable snacks, such as bubble ice cream and bubble tea candy.  Even today bubble tea continues to evolve, with new flavors and varieties constantly being introduced, and it remains a popular beverage worldwide. This is one of our favored bubble tea, that most of our customer buy more. It is definitely recommended and you will never regret yourself for purchase it.
